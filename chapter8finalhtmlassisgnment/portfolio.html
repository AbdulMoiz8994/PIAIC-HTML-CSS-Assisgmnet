        <strong>Why it's special:</strong>In 2014, Halfon was challenged in Parliament over money paid to his
        constituency office by a close associate of a Ukrainian magnate, Dmitry Firtash, recently arrested amid
        allegations of bribery.
        Firtash's close associate Robert Shetler-Jones,
        a Briton who was the former CEO of the Ukrainian's business empire Group and was currently deputy chairman of
        the group's supervisory council had donated £35,000 to Halfon's constituency office.
